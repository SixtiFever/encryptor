cipher()
    Function is taking an input message
    The message is listified
    Each elements index is found, corresponding to the cipher array
    A key shift is created for the alphabetic substitution
    Encrypted message is created by appending from the cipher_array with an index of the [key_shift]

de_cipher()
    Takes ciphered message and listifies iteration
    Reverses the cipher_array
    Uses a for loop to grab each element of ciphered message, and find corresponding index in the reversed array
    Apply key shift
    Return de-ciphered message (use join to mutate list)


Issue:
- If key_shift > the range between the end of the cipher_array and the highest index element in the message
    there runs into an IndexError: list index out of range
Solution:
- Repeated the cipher array so indexing can run into the next iteration should the above issue occur.
